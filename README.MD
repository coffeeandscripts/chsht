# CHSHT - console cheatsheet

## Overview

## Features

## Quickstart
~~~
$ make
$ ./chsht
$ make clean
~~~

## Plan
* make it similar to "man" pages:
    chsht vim
    Name
    Synopsis
    Description
    Commands
    Keys
      Press h for help, c for change, q to quit
    Useful Links
This means that we need to store chsht files locally so they can be edited
chsht -n vim (this makes a new entry for vim, and opens it in $EDITOR with default layout for you to edit)
